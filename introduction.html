                    How UART Works
                  </h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    In a basic UART communication system, there are two UART devices directly communicating with each other.
                    The transmitting UART will receive data from a controlled device such as a computer, and converts the parallel 
                    data into serial form, then transmit the serial data to the receiving UART. The receiving UART will then convert 
                    the serial data back into parallel form and send it to the end device. Only two wires are used for transmission 
                    of data between the transmitting and receiving UART. The data will flow from the transmitting pin of one UART device to the 
                    receiving pin of the other UART device and vice versa. 
                  </p>
                  <img
                        src="img/gifmain1.gif"
                        alt="Image"
                        class="img-fluid tm-mb-1"
                      />
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The UART interface transmit data asynchronously, which means that it does not have a clock signal to synchronize
                    the output bits from the transmitting device to the sampling bits by the receiving device. Instead of utilising a 
                    clock signal, the transmitting device adds extra bits called the start bit and stop bit to the packet of data that 
                    is being transmitted. The start bit represents the beginning whereas the stop bit represents the end of the data packet.
                    Thus, the receiving device will capture when to read the start bit.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    When the receiving device reads a start bit, it will read the following bits at a certain frequency. We call it as the 
                    baud rate. Baud rate is the speed in which information is being transmitted, expressed in bits per second (bps). In order to 
                    synchronize both UART devices, they both must operate at the same baud rate. The difference in baud rate for both devices 
                    has an acceptable range of only 10% before the timing of bits gets too far off, resulting in errors during transmitting and 
                    receiving of data.

                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    In UART transmission, the data transferred is organized in the form of packets. Each packet contains one start bit, 
                    five up to nine data bits which makes up the data frame, parity bit that can be or not be present, and lastly one or 
                    two stop bits.

                  <h3 class="tm-text-tertiary tm-mb-5">Start Bit</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    It is the first bit of a one-byte UART transmission. This indicates that the data is leaving its idle state (when it is 
                    not transmitting data), which is usually at logic high. When the transfer of data starts, the transmitting UART 
                    pulls the transmission line from logic high to low for one clock cycle. This in turn indicates to the receiving UART that 
                    data is going to be transmitted serially, as it detects the transition from logic high to low. Thus, it begins to read the 
                    bits in the data frame at the frequency of the baud rate.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    It is also called an overhead bit, which means that it helps a transmitting UART to communicate with a receiving UART between 
                    them but does not transmit useful data.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="tm-text-tertiary tm-mb-5">Data Frame</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The data frame contains the actual information that will be transmitted between two UART devices. It consists of five bits up to eight 
                    bits long if one parity bit is present. When there is no parity present, the data frame will consist up to nine bits instead. The data 
                    is usually transmitted across starting with the least significant bit. 
                  </p>

                        class="img-fluid tm-mb-1"
                      />
                  <h3 class="tm-text-tertiary tm-mb-5">Parity Bit</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    Mainly two types that exist - "odd parity" means that the bit will be at a logic high state when the data frame consists of a total of even 
                    ones or logic high bits, and "even parity" means that the bit will be at a logic high state when the data frame consists of a total of odd 
                    ones or logic high bits. For example, when "even parity" is activated and the data frame has three logic high bits, the parity bit becomes 
                    logic high, so that the total number of logic high bits that is being transmitted from the transmitter device is even. The purpose for this 
                    is ensuring that "odd parity" will always have odd number of logic high bits whereas "even parity" will always have even number of logic high bits.
                  </p>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    The parity bit also acts as a function for the receiving UART to detect changes to the incoming data during transmission. We must take note that 
                    bits can differ by several factors, as mentioned earlier, when the baud rates of both UART is not in sync, it could cause erros during transmission.
                  </p>

                  <h3 class="tm-text-tertiary tm-mb-5">Stop Bit</h3>
                  <p class="tm-mb-5">
                    It is the last bit of a one-byte UART transmission. This indicates the end of the data packet, when the transmitting UART drives the data transmission 
                    line to a high voltage from a low voltage for one or up to two bits duration. It is an overhead bit as well, similar to the start bit.
